Feature: Send data to the cloud
  As a city
  I want to know the light situation on the streets
  In order to selectively turn street lamps on or off


Scenario: Receive a brightness value
  Given I have a DBus brightness sensor
  And I subscribe to the azure receive topic on the local mqtt broker
  And I start streetlightd

  When I signal a new brightness value of 0.34

  Then I expect one mqtt message with the content:
    """
    brightness 0.34

    """
